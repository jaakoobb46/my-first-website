Basically I tried to make the website you sent me without looking at the code at all.

The only thing i did use was the colors, other than that everything I did was just based off of me looking
at the page. The fonts look way off because i had no idea which font that was, I just went with a standard
Sans-Serif because thats my favorite font due to the modern look and feel.
